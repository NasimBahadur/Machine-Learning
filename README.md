# Sign Language Recognition
Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist

Sign language is the basic way of verbal communication for deaf and dumb people. The **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is used in this work for Sign Language Recognition. Deep learning and CNN have combined to provide excellent results on a variety of problems in recent years, particularly **image classification**. To extract the most relevant elements of the image, the CNN model employs convolution and subsampling layers. These processes prevent images with invariant properties from impacting the classifier's performance, which explains why CNN can classify images with such high accuracy.
