Crop diseases are a major threat to food security, but their rapid identification remains difficult in many parts of the world due to the lack of the necessary infrastructure. Recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way crops disease diagnosis. The **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is used in this work for Tea Disease Classification. Deep learning and CNN have combined to provide excellent results on a variety of problems in recent years, particularly **image classification**. To extract the most relevant elements of the image, the CNN model employs convolution and subsampling layers. These processes prevent images with invariant properties from impacting the classifier's performance, which explains why CNN can classify images with such high accuracy.
