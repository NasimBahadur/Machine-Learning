**Sign Language Recognition**

Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist

Sign language is the basic way of verbal communication for deaf and dumb people. The CNN model is used in this work for Sign Language Recognition. Deep learning and CNN have combined to provide excellent results on a variety of problems in recent years, particularly image classification. To extract the most relevant elements of the image, the CNN model employs convolution and subsampling layers. These processes prevent images with invariant properties from impacting the classifier's performance, which explains why CNN can classify images with such high accuracy.


**Covid-19 Recognition Using Covid Symptoms**

The Covid-19 pandemic created havoc around the world. There are different sorts of symptoms of this virus which helps to detect and classify Covid affected and non-covid affected patients. In this work, four different machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Neural Network and Random Forest were implemented to choose the best algorithm based on the accuracy and detect Covid-19 accurately based on their symptoms.
