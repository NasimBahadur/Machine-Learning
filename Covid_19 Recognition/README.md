The Covid-19 pandemic created havoc around the world. Various kinds of preliminary symptoms exist in Covid-19 virus-affected patients. Based on those symptoms, we tried to detect and classify Covid affected and non-covid-affected patients. In this work, we use the ensemble learning method. Four different machine learning algorithms such as **Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Neural Network and Random Forest** were implemented and then choose the best algorithm based on the accuracy and detect Covid-19 estimated patients based on their symptoms.
